Autoregressive models on time series data can be a challenging when it comes to noise or a "weird" distribution 

This repo features a synthetic AR (autoregressive) generator, where we can control many parameters of the AR model.
It basically allows us to simulate an AR process.
By using this, one can introduce noise and/or control other parameters, of a time-series dataset.

Using a synthetic dataset helps evaluate different machine learned models for noise and "weirdly distributed" data.
