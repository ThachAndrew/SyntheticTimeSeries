Autoregressive models on time series data can be a challenging when it comes to noise or a "weird" distribution 

This repo features a synthetic AR generator, where we can control many paramaters of the AR model.
By using this, one can introduce noise, or control other parameters, of a time-series dataset.

Using a synthetic dataset helps evaluate different machine learned models for noise and "weirdly distributed" data.
